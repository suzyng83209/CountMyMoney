# CountMyMoney
A React-Native app (my first!) made for the Shopify Mobile Development challenge

## What it does:
this app fetches data fom a shopify endpoint that returns a list of orders and calculates the total revenue as well as the number of "Aerodynamic Cotton Keyboards" sold.

## To run:
1. Clone the repo
2. run ```react-native run-android``` in the directory with an android emulator or android device running.
